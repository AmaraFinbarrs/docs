PlanetScale Insights gives you a detailed look into the active queries running against your database. This in-dashboard tool allows you to identify queries that are running too often, too long, returning too much data, and more. You can scroll through the performance graph to detect the time or [Deploy Request](/concepts/deploy-requests) that a query was impacted.

## Insights page overview

PlanetScale Insights is currently in beta. You can opt-in on your database Settings page at `https://app.planetscale.com/<YOUR-ORG>/<YOUR-DATABASE>/settings/beta-features`.

To view Query Insights for your database, head to the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com), select your database, and click the "**Query insights**" tab.

Below is an overview of what you'll find on this page. If you'd like a quick look at how this all works together, check out the [Debugging queries with Insights section](#debugging-queries-with-insights).

### Branch selection

![PlanetScale Insights branch selection](/img/docs/insights-branches.png) 

This dropdown on the top right lets you select what branch you want to analyze. This applies to the entire Insights page.

### Insights graph

![PlanetScale Insights graph](/img/docs/insights-graph.png)

This graph depicts your database activity over a 24-hour period. You'll also see links to any deploy requests at the time that you deployed them.

You can click the dates listed above to scroll through the past seven days. If you're on our free Developer plan, activity is limited to the previous 24 hours. 

### Graph metrics selection

![PlanetScale Insights graph metrics selection - rows written](/img/docs/insights-graph-metrics-selection.png) 

The dropdown on the top left lets you select what metric you want to see on the graph. You can hover over a specific time on the graph to see the exact metric(s) for that time period.

The available options are:

- **Rows read per second** &mdash; Total count followed by rows read per second.
- **Rows written per second** &mdash; Total count followed by rows written per second.
- **Query latency (ms)** &mdash; Two line charts showing p50 and p90 latency. This means 50% and 90% of requests, respectively, completed faster than the time listed.
- **Queries per second** &mdash; Total queries per second.

### Queries list

![PlanetScale Insights recent queries list](/img/docs/insights-query-list.png)

The table underneath the graph shows all queries performed on your database in the past 24 hours. Queries over 1 minute are clickable for a deeper look. You can also sort the columns for quick analysis.

**Available query statistics**:

- **Keyspace** &mdash; The table(s) being queried or modified.
- **Count** &mdash; The number of times this query has run.
- **Total Time (ms)** &mdash; The total time the query has run in milliseconds.
- **Time per query (ms)** &mdash; The number of milliseconds each individual query takes to run. This is calculated from total time divided by count.
- **Rows returned** &mdash; The number of rows fetched by a `SELECT` statement.
- **Rows read** &mdash; The total number of rows read. This is the number that directly affects your [rows read billing calculation](/concepts/billing#understanding-rows-read). 
- **Rows affected** &mdash; The number of rows modified by an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.

In [the next section](#debugging-queries-with-insights), you'll see a practical example showing how you can use these stats to debug slow queries.

You can customize the metrics that show up on the Queries list by clicking the "Columns" dropdown.

### Query deep dive

Clicking on a query in the Queries list will open a new page with more information about that query, such as:

- Query pattern
- Slow instances of the query during the selected time frame
- Query tags
- An option to generate the query explain plan

If you toggle "Show explain plan" you can generate the execution plan for the selected query. You may have to fill in some sample values, as we consider the data private and normalize it away.

## Debugging queries with Insights

Now that you know what metrics are surfaced with Insights, let's go over a practical use case.

Let's say you deploy a schema change to your production database, and you later notice a users list page in your application is running slowly.

To debug this, you could come to your Insights page and look at the graph to identify any anomalies. Look for any spikes in *rows read* or *rows written*. If this performance impact coincided with a deployment, you'd see the exact deploy request on the graph next to the spike. This gives you direct insight into what schema change caused the performance issues.

Next, you can drill down further by looking at the "Queries during the last 24 hours" table. If you sort the table by "Total time", you can quickly surface any slow queries.

Click on any queries that seem to run longer than you'd expect, and from there, you'll be able to see any instances of the query running slowly.

In the example scenario of a slow users page, let's say you identify the following query running slowly:

CODE SNIPPET

The graph analysis also showed that the slowdown coincided with a deploy request from a few hours ago. You click the deploy request and see that during the schema change, you accidentally dropped an index! The dropped index impacted the query above, causing it to run slowly.

With this knowledge, you can now open up a new deploy request re-adding the index. After deploying it to production, you can come back to the Insights page to confirm performance is back to normal.
