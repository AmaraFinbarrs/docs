## Overview

With the PlanetScale Portals beta, you can create a replica of your production database in [any additional region](/concepts/regions).

This feature supports globally distributed applications by enabling your database to perform low latency reads in the regions closest to your users.

## Concepts

### Replication across Regions
PlanetScale replicates your data across regions with an asynchronous strategy; first storing your changes in the primary region and then forwarding them to your read-only region(s). The time that it takes those changes to propagate to your read-only region can be defined as "replication lag" and be measured by issuing the following statement to your read-only regions:
```
mysql> select max_repl_lag();
+----------------+
| max_repl_lag() |
+----------------+
|              0 |
+----------------+
```
The `max_repl_lag()` function will return an instantaneous measurement of the maximum amount of seconds it has been since your read-only region has stored changes made to your primary region.

### Read-only Connections
Connecting to a read-only replica will allow you to query your data, but will not allow you to insert, update, or delete it.

## How to create a read-only region

1. In the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com), select the database you want to add a read-only region to.
2. Click on the production branch.
3. Click the "**Add region**" button.

4. Select the desired region from the dropdown of [available regions](/concepts/regions).

5. Click "**Add region**" and wait for your data to finish initially replicating across regions.
6. Optionally, connect to your new read-only region by clicking the ellipsis and selecting "**Connect**". This will return the connection credentials you can use in your application. 

## Availability and pricing

PlanetScale Portals is only available on our [paid Scaler and Enterprise plans](https://planetscale.com/pricing).

### Storage costs

Your storage costs will increase linearly with the amount of read-only regions added. For example, if your production branch is 10GB, each region added will increase your total storage cost by 10GB.

For more information on storage billing costs, see our [Billing documentation](/concepts/billing).

### Rows read

Queries issued to each read-only region will contribute to your total billable row reads per month. Your invoice details will show a new line for rows read from each region.
