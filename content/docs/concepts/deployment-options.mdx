## Overview

PlanetScale offers three different deployment options to suit your application and business needs.

## Multi-tenant

Multi-tenant is the default deployment option. When you sign up for a PlanetScale account, whether on a Hobby, Scaler, or Team plan, your databases will be created on our multi-tenant deployment offering.

### Multi-tenant highlights

- Your database runs on PlanetScale's [secure](/concepts/security) cloud infrastructure. 
- Shared infrastructure amongst other PlanetScale customers
- Lowest cost plan
- Option to upgrade default resources

## PlanetScale Managed

For companies that require their data to be **on their own** AWS or GCP account, we also offer a Managed deployment option. 

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The PlanetScale Managed offering is only available on our [Enterprise plan](/concepts/billing#planetscale-plans). If you're interested, please [reach out](https://planetscale.com/contact) and we can figure out a custom solution for your use case.
</InfoBlock>

### PlanetScale Managed highlights

- Your database runs on your own AWS or GCP account using PlanetScale deployments
- This account will be managed by PlanetScale via:
  - **AWS** &mdash; [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) (recommended) or [VPC Peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html)
  - **GCP** &mdash; [Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-access-options)
- You can continue to use the PlanetScale UI and CLI in the same way that you would our general multi-tenant offering, but the infrastructure will run on an account owned by you
- PlanetScale does not have access to your data
- You control data location with your own AWS regions
- Because you own this account, you can run additional auditing and monitoring as needed

## Single-tenant

For companies that need their data on an isolated AWS or GCP account, but don't want to create their own account, we offer the Single-tenant option.

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The PlanetScale Single-tenant offering is only available on our [Enterprise plan](/concepts/billing#planetscale-plans). If you're interested, please [reach out](https://planetscale.com/contact) and we can figure out a custom solution for your use case.

### Single-tenant highlights

- We create and manage an AWS or GCP account for you
- Your resources run on this separate account, apart from other customers, using PlanetScale infrastructure
- We can create custom regions for you not offered in our Multi-tenant deployment option
