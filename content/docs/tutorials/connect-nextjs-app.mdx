In this tutorial, you'll create a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to connect to a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) database.


## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli)
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:

```sh
pscale auth login
```

## Set up the database

Create a new database with the following command:

```sh
pscale database create <DATABASE_NAME>
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  A branch, `main`, was automatically created when you created your database, so you can use that for `BRANCH_NAME` in the steps below. 
</InfoBlock>

## Set up the starter Next.js app

Clone the [starter repository](https://github.com/planetscale/nextjs-starter).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/planetscale/nextjs-starter
```

Install the dependencies.

```sh
cd nextjs-starter
npm install
```

Next, you'll need to create a database username and password through the CLI to connect to your application. If you'd prefer to use the dashboard for this step, you can find those instructions in the [Connection Strings documentation](/concepts/connection-strings#creating-a-password) and then come back here to finish setup.

First, create your `.env` file by renaming the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```sh
mv .env.example .env
```

Next, using the PlanetScale CLI, create a new username and password for the branch of your database:

```sh
pscale password create <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME> <PASSWORD_NAME>
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The `PASSWORD_NAME` value represents the name of the username and password being generated. You can have multiple credentials for a branch, so this gives you a way to categorize them. To manage your passwords in the dashboard, go to your database overview page, click "Settings", and then click "Passwords".
</InfoBlock>

Take note of the values returned to you, as you won't be able to see this password again.

```
Password production-password was successfully created.
Please save the values below as they will not be shown again

  NAME                  USERNAME       ACCESS HOST URL                     ROLE               PASSWORD
 --------------------- -------------- ----------------------------------- ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
  production-password   xxxxxxxxxxxxx   xxxxxx.us-east-2.psdb.cloud   Can Read & Write   pscale_pw_xxxxxxx                                                                                    
```

You'll use these properties to construct your connection string, which will be the value for `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file. Update the `DATABASE_URL` property with your connection string in the following format:

```
mysql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<ACCESS_HOST_URL>/<DATABASE_NAME>?sslaccept=strict
```

Push the database schema to your PlanetScale database using Prisma.

```sh
npx prisma db push
```

Run the seed script to populate your database with `Product` and `Category` data.

```sh
npm run seed
```

## Run the app

Run the app with following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to see the running application.

## Deploying

After you've got your application running locally, you may want to deploy it. To do so, you'll need to promote your database branch (`main` by default) to be the production branch ([read the branching documentation for more information](/concepts/branching)).

You can do this in the CLI with:

```sh
pscale branch promote <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

You can also promote a branch to production in the PlanetScale dashboard by going to your database overview page and clicking "Promote branch".

### Deploy to Vercel

If you'd like to deploy to Vercel, check out our [Deploy to Vercel documentation](/tutorials/deploy-to-vercel#deploy-to-vercel).

### Deploy to Netlify

Follow the instructions in our [Netlify deployment documentation](/tutorials/nextjs-planetscale-netlify-template#one-click-deploy-to-netlify) to deploy to Netlify.

*Note: The `Netlify.toml` file in this repository includes the configuration for you to customize the `DATABASE_URL` property on the initial deploy.
