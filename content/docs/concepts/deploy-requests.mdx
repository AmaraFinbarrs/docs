## Overview

Deploy requests are an integral part of the PlanetScale workflow. 

<VideoBlock src="/img/docs/deploy-request.mp4"></VideoBlock>

## Create a deploy request

**Note**: Your database must have a **production branch** before you can create a deploy request.

1. Go to the overview page of the development branch you want to deploy to production.
2. Under "**Create a deploy request**", select the branch you want to deploy to.
3. Add a comment about the deploy request.
4. Click "**Create deploy request**".

## Review and deploy a deploy request

Once a deploy request is created, you or your team is able to review it, and, optionally, approve it, before deploying it to production. 

PlanetScale will also check if the request is deployable. This includes checking for issues like [foreign key constraints](/learn/operating-without-foreign-key-constraints), [missing unique key](/learn/change-single-unique-key), and more. We also check if there are any conflicts with the production schema that could prevent a clean merge.

1. Click the "**Deploy requests**" tab on the database overview page.
2. Select the open deploy request you want to review.
3. Under "**Summary**", you'll see if the request is deployable.
4. To review the schema changes, click the "**Schema changes**" tab.
5. You'll see the proposed changes here. New additions are highlighted in green and deletions are highlighted in red.
6. If you have required deploy requests to be approved before deployment, you'll also see the option to "**Approve changes**" or "**Leave a comment**" on the "**Schema changes**" tab.
7. Once the request is approved, if required, it's ready to be added to the deploy queue. On the "**Summary**" tab, click "**Add changes to deploy queue**" and the deployment will begin immediately or be queued if there are other pending deployments.
8. Once a request a deployed, you have 30 minutes to "undo" it using our [Rewind feature](#revert-a-deploy-request).

If you would like to require approval before a request can be deployed, go to the "**Settings**" page for your database and check the "**Deploy requests require approval before deploy**" box. You must be an administrator to enable this.

## Close a deploy request

If you decide you don't want to proceed with a deploy request, you can easily close it.

1. Click the "**Deploy requests**" tab on the database overview page.
2. Select the request you want to close.
3. Click on the "**Close deploy request**" button on the right-hand side.

## Revert a deploy request

If you ever merge a deploy request, only to realize you need to undo it, PlanetScale can handle that! The **Rewind feature** allows you to revert a recently deployed schema change **without losing any data** that was written during that time.

  The Rewind feature is currently in limited beta. You must enroll your database to access this feature.

### Revert a deployment with Rewind

You can revert a deployment for **up to 30 minutes** after the deploy request was deployed. After the 30 minutes is up, the deployment becomes permanent and you will no longer have the option to revert.

1. Select the deploy request you want to revert.
2. If you're not already enrolled, you'll see a Beta banner underneath the comment box on the deploy request page. Click "**Enroll database**" to opt-in to the Rewind limited beta.
3. Once ready, deploy your deploy request.
4.
