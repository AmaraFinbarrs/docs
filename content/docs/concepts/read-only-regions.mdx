## Overview

With PlanetScale Portals, you can create a replica of your production database in [any additional region](/concepts/regions).

This feature supports globally distributed applications by enabling your database to perform low latency reads in the regions closest to your users.

## How to create a read-only region

1. In the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com), select the database you want to add a read-only region to.
2. Click on the production branch.
3. Click the "Add region" button.
4. Select the desired region from the dropdown of [available regions](/concepts/regions).
5. Click "Launch".
6. Copy the connection string.
7. 

## Availability and pricing

PlanetScale Portals is only available on our [paid Scalar and Enterprise plans](https://planetscale.com/pricing). 

### Storage costs

Your storage costs will increase linearly with the amount of read-only regions added. For example, if your production branch is 10GB, each region added will increase your total storage cost by 10GB. For more information on storage billing costs, see our [Billing documentation](/concepts/billing).

### Rows read

Queries issued to each read-only region will contribute to your total billable row reads per month. Your invoice details will show a new line for rows read from each region.
