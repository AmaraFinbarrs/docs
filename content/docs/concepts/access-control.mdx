## Overview

When you set up your PlanetScale account, you're asked to create an **Organization**. 

An organization is essentially a container for your databases, settings, and members. You can create multiple organizations in the same account for different applications or use cases. Within each organization, you can add members and assign them different roles. For even more control, you can [assign roles at the database level](#database-administrator) within each organization as well.

## Roles and permissions

We currently support three different roles in your organization: Organization Adminstrator, Organization Member, and Database Administrator.

### Organization Administrator

An `Organization Administrator` can perform all actions in an organization, as well as all actions on _every_ database within that organization.

### Organization Member

An `Organization Member` can only perform limited actions within an organization and on all databases in that organization.

### Database Administrator

A `Database Administrator` can perform all actions on the database for which they were assigned the `Databases Administrator` role.

This role is assigned at the **database level** and therefore **does not** have any organization-level permissions. If you want to [grant a member _full_ access to manage one or several databases](#assign-roles-at-a-database-level), but not the organization, then this is the role you want.

## Organization-level permissions

Each role has a set of permissions assigned to it which determine what actions that role is allowed to take within an organization or database.

The following table describes permissions assigned at the organization level for `Organization Administrators` and `Organization Members`. Because `Database Administrators` don't have any organization-level permissions, they are not included in this table.

## Database-level permissions

The following table describes the permissions assigned at the **database level** for `Organization Administrators`, `Organization Members`, and `Database Administrators`.

For `Organization Administrators` and `Organization Members`, these permissions apply to every database in the organization. Because the `Database Administrator` role is assigned at the database-level, the permissions are for the specific database(s) for which they have the `Database Administrator` role. 

| Action          | Description       | Organization Administrator | Organization Member | Database Administrator |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Manage billing | Update the billing plan of a specific database | ✔ | ✘ | ✔ |
| Create and view branches | Create or view a database branch | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Create and view branches | Create or view a database branch | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Delete non-production branches | Delete a non-production branch of a specific database | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |

| Promote branches | Promote a branch of a specific database to production | ✔ | ✘ | ✔ |
| View database | View a database in an organization | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Manage database | Delete, update settings, or import a database | ✔ | ✘ | ✔ |
| Create deploy requests | Create a deploy request for a branch on a specific database | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Manage beta features | Opt-in or opt-out of a beta feature for a database | ✔ | ✘ | ✔ |
| View database members | View one or all database members | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Manage database members | Update database member roles, add, or remove database members | ✔ | ✘ | ✔ |
| View query statistics | View query statistics for an organization's databases | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |

An organization may have several databases, and an `Organization Member` may have different access to each database depending on whether or not they also have the `Database Administrator` role.

## Assign organization roles to members

You can follow the steps below to assign roles to your members. You must be an Organization Administrator to modify member roles.

- In the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com/), click on the Settings tab in the top navigation. 
- Click on "Members" in the sidebar on the left.
- From here, you can click on the dropdown on the right under the "Role" column to select the role you want to apply to each member.

You can also invite new members to your organization and assign roles once they accept their invitation. New members will be added with the [`Organization Member`](#organization-member) role by default.

<InfoBlock type="note">
  Member role management is issued at the organization level. Each organization in your account may have different members with different access levels.
</InfoBlock>

## Assign roles at a database level

To assign a member the role of `Database Administrator`, follow the steps outlined below. You must be an Organization Administrator or an existing Database Administrator to manage the `Database Administrator` role.
