## Overview

Deploy requests are an integral part of the [PlanetScale workflow](/concepts/planetscale-workflow). Database branching, coupled with deploy requests, allows you to **deploy non-blocking schema changes to your production database with zero downtime**. Additionally, you have the option to [undo deployments](#revert-a-schema-change) without losing any data that was written during that time with just the click of a button.

## Create a deploy request

**Note**: Your database must have a **production branch** before you can create a deploy request.

1. Go to the overview page of the development branch you want to deploy to production.
2. Under "**Create a deploy request**", select the branch you want to deploy to.
3. Add a comment about the deploy request.
4. Click "**Create deploy request**".

## Review and deploy a deploy request

Once a deploy request is created, you or your team is able to review it and, optionally, approve it before deploying it to production. 

PlanetScale will check if the request is deployable. This includes checking for issues like [foreign key constraints](/learn/operating-without-foreign-key-constraints), [missing unique key](/learn/change-single-unique-key), and more. We also check if there are any known conflicts with the production schema that could prevent a clean merge. While we attempt to find all possible conflicts, it is ultimately up to you to confirm merge details.

1. Click the "**Deploy requests**" tab on the database overview page.
2. Select the open deploy request you want to review.
3. Under "**Summary**", you'll see if the request is deployable.
4. To review the schema changes, click the "**Schema changes**" tab.
5. You'll see the proposed changes here. New additions are highlighted in green, and deletions are highlighted in red.
6. If you have required deploy requests to be approved before deployment, you'll also see the option to "**Approve changes**" or "**Leave a comment**" on the "**Schema changes**" tab.
7. Once the request is approved, if required, it's ready to be added to the deploy queue. On the "**Summary**" tab, click "**Add changes to deploy queue**", and the deployment will begin immediately or be queued if there are other pending deployments.
8. Once a request is deployed, you have **30 minutes to "undo"** it using our [Rewind feature](#revert-a-schema-change).

If you would like to require approval before a request can be deployed, go to the "**Settings**" page for your database and check the "**Deploy requests require approval before deploy**" box. You must be an administrator to enable this.

## Close a deploy request

If you decide you don't want to proceed with a deploy request, you can easily close it.

1. Click the "**Deploy requests**" tab on the database overview page.
2. Select the request you want to close.
3. Click on the "**Close deploy request**" button on the right-hand side.

## Revert a schema change

If you ever merge a deploy request, only to realize you need to undo it, PlanetScale can handle that! The **Rewind feature** allows you to revert a recently deployed schema change, while maintaining any data that was written to the original schema during that time.

### How to revert a deployment with Rewind

You can revert a deployment for **up to 30 minutes** after the deploy request was deployed. After the 30 minute period is up, the deployment becomes permanent, and you will no longer have the option to revert.

If you're not already enrolled, you'll see a Beta banner underneath the comment box on the deploy request page. Click "**Enroll database**" to opt-in to the Rewind limited beta terms.

You can also go to the database Settings page, click "Beta features", and check "Enroll this database in the Rewind limited beta" to opt-in.

1. Select the deploy request you want to revert.
2. To revert the schema changes made with the deploy request, click "**Revert changes**" and confirm.
3. Your production database will immediately be reverted back to its previous schema before the deploy request.
4. Any data that was written in the time between you deploying and reverting will remain in your database.
5. The Deploy Request will be closed, but the branch will remain for you to continue development on if you choose.

### When is data not retained?

There are some scenarios where some data is not retained when you revert your changes.

1. You add a table or column to your schema and then revert it. If any data was written to those newly introduced fields during the time between deployment and reverting, that data will not be retained upon revert, as the fields will no longer exist.

### When are you unable to revert a schema change?

There are also some edge cases where reverting a schema change is not possible. We will always attempt to revert, but if there are scenarios where your data integrity is at risk, we will not proceed with the revert. The following are some cases where a revert will fail:

1. If you deploy a schema change that expands the length of some column, such as changing from `VARCHAR(10)` to `VARCHAR(50)` and immediately add data greater than 10 characters to it, a revert attempt may fail.  This is to protect your data. You may have data that was written to the `VARCHAR(50)` field in that time that will not fit in the smaller 10 character space. However, if no data is added between deployment and revert, the revert process can proceed.
2. Some examples of other similar scenarios where revert won't be possible (only if larger sized data is added between deployment and revert) are:
   - `INT` to `BIGINT`
   - `NOT NULL` to `NULL`
   - `TIMESTAMP` to `TIMESTAMP(6)`
   - `utf8` to `utf8mb4`
   - Any other operation that expands the size of a field
3. If you deploy a schema change that removes a unique key or relaxes a unique constraint, and in the time between deployment and attempting to revert, you insert rows that would otherwise conflict with that constraint, the revert may fail.
4. Another uncommon but possible scenario: you deploy a schema change that has a `NOT NULL` column without a `DEFAULT` value, combined with an `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN` statement for that column. If you insert some rows between the deployment and the revert attempt, the revert will fail. We will not be able to re-add that column for the newly inserted rows and will not know how to populate it.

### Billing considerations

The process of reverting a schema change will not count toward your `read`, `write`, or storage limits. You will not be charged for the background processes we run, like creating a copy of the affected schema and data.

You may see some temporary `_vt` tables in your database. These are used to facilitate the deployment and revert process and do not count toward your storage.
