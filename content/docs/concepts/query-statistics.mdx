## Overview

PlanetScale Insights gives you a detailed look into the active queries running against your database. This in-dashboard tool allows you to identify queries that are running too often, too long, returning too much data, and more. You can scroll through the performance graph to detect exactly what time or what Deploy Request impacted a query.

## Available statistics

- **Keyspace** &mdash; The table, or tables for a join, being queried or modified.
- **Count** &mdash; The number of times this query has run.
- **Time (ms)** &mdash; The total amount of time this query has run, in milliseconds.
- **Rows read** &mdash;
- **Rows affected** &mdash; The number of rows modified by an insert, update, or delete statement.
- **Rows returned** &mdash; The number of rows fetched by a select statement.
- **Time per query (ms)** &mdash; The number of milliseconds each individual query takes to run. This is calculated from total time divided by count.
