# PlanetScale Documentation

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the PlanetScale Documentation repo!

## Request content

If you'd like to request content around using PlanetScale or general MySQL/database questions we'd love to hear from you!

Head over to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/planetscale/docs/issues), click "New issue", and select the appropriate template.

## Contribute to docs

We welcome contributions to the PlanetScale documentation! If you have a fix for an existing issue or you found a typo/bug, you can [open a new PR](https://github.com/planetscale/docs/pulls) in this repo.

For larger pull requests, such as language/framework quickstarts, we ask that you [open an issue](https://github.com/planetscale/docs/issues) to request the new content instead of creating it yourself.
